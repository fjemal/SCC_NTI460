What have you completed since the last report?
After meeting on Saturday, the plan we put forward to be done in this week was unsuccessful. The network was not set
so, we are running behind the schedule.

What do you plan to complete by the next report?
we tried to fix the network issues and go from there, installing and configuring openstack using ansible and configuring the iscsi.
What is getting in your way? configuring the vlans' and configuring the network is our main problem right now.
