Status Report #5

What have you completed since the last report? On Saturday we met with the group and discussed how to go forward with our plan. 
We discussed about networking and physical components of our project. I installed and configured iscsi on target server.
What do you plan to complete by the next report? I will install and configure iscsi on client server.

What is getting in your way? It's hard to meet with all groups at the same time.
