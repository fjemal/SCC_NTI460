Status Report # 1

Date: 04/13/2018

What have you completed since the last report?

This is my first report which includes the meeting and some research I have done. 
After class meeting and briefed about both classes procedures I started reading and start playing with
ansible playbooks. After I read the ansible doc. which provided on slack and some other additional sites, I wrote first
ansible playbook which spins instances on EC2. This will fjemal/nti-460.

what do you plan to complete by the next report?
By the next report I will read more about Ansible and playbooks.

what is getting in your way? 
The first thing getting in my way is that before I start reading
about ansible I was so worried since I never used it before. I thought it needs hard coding, since I'm not 
coder. After I start reading it looks great since this the first time I read and use ansible.
