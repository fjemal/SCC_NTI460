Status Report # 2

What have you completed since the last report?
After the project proposal was posted on slack, I made some suggestion to our project that to include ISCSI storage and sent 
the link to the project leader

What do you plan to complete by the next report? 
For the next plan I want to figure it out how to get access to the server room and real understanding how the physical and softer works on the
blade center.

What is getting in your way?
The main problem I have right now is that I can't get acccess to the server room. I have to get permission from David to get in. It's hard to get
access to the server room.
