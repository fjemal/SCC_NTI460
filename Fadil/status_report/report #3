Status Report # 3
Date: 4/24/18

What have you completed since the last report?

We met on Saturday with the team to setup all machines to configuration and to install
software on each machine, but due to incompatible software with our BladeCenter, we couldn't finish
the installation and configuration. At the last David come and promised to set up the new machine if possible.

What do you plan to complete by the next report?
By the next report, if I get a new machine to the place where I get easy, I will install the software and 
prepare script which installs open stack and some software using ansible.

What is getting in your way?
Still have limited access to the cisco room, since don't have an access key.
